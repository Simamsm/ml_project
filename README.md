# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a significant global health concern, responsible for numerous annual deaths. This repository houses a machine learning project focused on predicting heart disease probability using various factors.

## Dataset

The `Datasets` folder contains essential project data. With 11 features, it enables prediction of heart disease likelihood. The aim is to create a predictive model for early cardiovascular disease detection and management.

## Project Overview

The `Final_project_template.ipynb` notebook is the project's core implementation. It guides through data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation. The goal is crafting a robust model for accurate heart disease prediction based on provided features.

The `original_project.ipynb` notebook may showcase project evolution or alternative approaches. Both notebooks offer insights into the project's development.

## Key Insights

Key findings include:

- CVDs, notably heart attacks and strokes, drive global mortality.
- Younger individuals face cardiovascular risks, with a third of related deaths under 70.
- Lower cholesterol levels correlate with higher heart disease incidence.
- Resting electrocardiographic results and downsloping impact heart disease likelihood.
- Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl doesn't directly affect heart disease.

## Model Performance

The developed machine learning model demonstrates strong performance. The deep learning model achieves a 97% recall score on test data, effectively identifying heart disease cases.
